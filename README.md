# Alzheimer-s-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project, developed in VS Code, utilizes the Alzheimer’s Prediction Dataset (Global) from Kaggle to analyze risk factors and predict Alzheimer’s diagnosis using machine learning models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and training models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN. Performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices to compare model effectiveness. The project provides insights into key contributing factors, helping to understand Alzheimer’s risk prediction better.
